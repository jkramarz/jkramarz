# Hi, I'm Jakub 👾

Security engineer with a DevOps past. I focus on practical, real-world security—securing infrastructure, improving deployment pipelines, and making sure embedded systems don’t become security nightmares. Before switching to IT security, I spent over five years in DevOps, working on server and networking security, CI/CD, and system architecture.

## 🛠️ What I Do

* Infrastructure & Security – Hardening servers, networks, and deployment pipelines.
* Embedded Systems Security – ARM, AVR, and other low-level tech that needs securing.
* DevOps & CI/CD – Automating deployments without introducing new attack vectors.
* Hackerspace & Hardware – Associated with Hackerspace Kraków, always experimenting with tech.


## 📌 Background

* Security & DevOps Specialist – Switched from devops to security, now focusing on infrastructure protection and secure system design.
* Hands-on Problem Solver – Prefers breaking and fixing real systems over theoretical discussions.
